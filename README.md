# AI/ML Learning Journey ðŸš€

Hi, I'm Azusa (Ahmed Faazil).  
I'm learning Data Science, AI, and Quantum Computing from scratch with the goal of doing research with MIT or Ivy League professors in 12th grade.  
This repo tracks my journey from total beginner to expert.

## ðŸ§  Day 5 Log â€“ Titanic Dataset (Survival Rates)

- Grouped data by Sex, Pclass
- Learned how `.groupby()` + `.mean()` helps find trends
- Discovered: 
  - Women survived more than men
  - 1st Class passengers had higher survival
## ðŸ§  Day 6 Log â€“ Rule-Based AI Prediction

- Built a function to predict Titanic survival based on sex, class, and age
- Achieved ~78% accuracy using manual rules
- Modified logic to explore better rules
- Understood the limitations of hardcoded rule-based models
